                provide such further PII. However, declining to provide such PII sought may result 
                in Users not being able to use such specific service of the Platform that required 
                such additional PII.

                        SamparkBindhu shall, at all times, store Users PII in its cloud server storage (operated 
                        by external vendor) and is General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR") 
                        compliant. SamparkBindhu ensures that such cloud storage mechanism does not result in 
                        storage of Users PII in any server outside the territory of the Republic of India.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users unique user ID allocated to Users at the time of registration shall be accorded a 
                        confidential code internally in its stored form such that Users PII cannot be linked to 
                        Users USER ID without access to the specific code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Further all User's PII shall be stored in an encrypted and anonymized form. Users PII 
                        is stored in secured networks and only limited number of persons can access Users PII. 
                        These personnel are conferred special access rights and are required to keep the information 
                        confidential. Such persons are themselves bound by stringent standards and contractual terms 
                        on their obligations in relation to maintaining the confidentiality of Users PII.

                        All sensitive/credit information Users supply are encrypted and anonymized. 
                        Further, SamparkBindhu shall employ a private key and public key mechanism to maintain 
                        the integrity of the encryption. However, in the event of any regulatory inquiry, 
                        including court issued warrants or written request from Government agencies supported 
                        by warrants, SamparkBindhu shall have no option but to de-encrypt the PII to the extent 
                        sought and share the same with such regulator or court or appropriate authority upon 
                        receiving specific warrant from such authority issued by a competent Court. In such an 
                        event SamparkBindhu shall not be liable in any way for such disclosure and SamparkBindhu 
                        shall not be responsible to either inform Users or seek Users prior approval. SamparkBindhu 
                        regularly carries out security audit of its website and server storage mechanisms and any
